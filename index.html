        <h2>hey there!</h2>
        I'm Lena, a soon-to-be graduate of Brown University! I study <b class = "purple">visual arts</b> and <b class = "purple">psychology</b>, and like to apply both those fields into my work as a designer.
        <p>
            I've interned as a graphic designer and project manager at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and as a design fellow at the General Services Administration with Coding It Forward; but currently, I work as a graphic designer and publicity coordinator at my school's LGBTQ Center.

        </p>

            When Iâ€™m not busy trying out different boba toppings, you can find me working on my visual novel at a nearby coffee shop or playing DND with friends.
